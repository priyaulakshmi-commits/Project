# JVM Basics

## What is JDK?
JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to develop Java applications.  
It includes tools like the Java compiler (`javac`) and libraries needed to write, compile, and run Java programs.

## What is JRE?
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is used to run Java applications.  
It contains the JVM and standard Java libraries, but it does not include tools for developing programs.

## What is JVM?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the part of Java that actually runs the program.  
It converts Java bytecode into machine-specific instructions so the program can run on any operating system.

## What is Bytecode?
When a Java program is compiled, it is converted into bytecode instead of machine code.  
Bytecode is a platform-independent format stored in `.class` files and can be executed by any JVM.

## What does “Write Once, Run Anywhere” mean?
Java programs are written once and compiled into bytecode.  
This bytecode can run on any operating system such as Windows, Linux, or macOS, as long as a JVM is available.

Because of this, the same Java program does not need to be rewritten for different platforms, making Java portable and easy to use.
